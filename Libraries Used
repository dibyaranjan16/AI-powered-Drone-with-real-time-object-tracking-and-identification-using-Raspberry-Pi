>>> Libraries Used  
The AI-powered drone project relies on several open-source libraries across computer vision, machine learning, hardware interfacing, and system control. These libraries ensure smooth communication between 
components and efficient real-time processing.

1. Python 3.x (Core Language) 
• Python was chosen due to its ease of development, wide community support, and compatibility with both AI and embedded hardware. 
• Version 3.9 or later is preferred for compatibility with modern libraries like TensorFlow Lite and OpenCV. 

2. OpenCV (cv2) 
• Module: cv2 
• Use: Image capture, frame resizing, color conversion, drawing bounding boxes, and camera exposure control. 
• Sample functions: 
o cv2.VideoCapture(), cv2.resize(), cv2.cvtColor(), 
cv2.rectangle(), cv2.imshow() 

3. TensorFlow Lite Runtime 
• Module: tflite_runtime.interpreter 
• Use: Executes lightweight AI models on the Raspberry Pi without needing full TensorFlow installation. 
• Enables real-time inference from .tflite models using edge-optimized 
APIs. 
• Functions used: 
o Interpreter(), allocate_tensors(), set_tensor(), invoke(), get_tensor() 

4. PySerial 
• Module: serial 
• Use: Establishes UART communication between Raspberry Pi and Flight Controller. 
• Handles command transmission like “YAW_LEFT”, “HOLD”, etc. 
• Key methods: 
o serial.Serial(), write(), read(), flush() 

5. NumPy 
• Module: numpy 
• Use: Numerical operations, tensor shaping, input normalization for AI model inference. 
• Sample usage: 
o np.expand_dims(), np.float32(), array slicing 

6. RPi.GPIO (Optional) 
• Module: RPi.GPIO 
• Use: If GPIO pins are used for PWM control, status LEDs, or hardware triggers. 
• In current setup, it may be used for simple status indication or onboard sensors. 
  
7. Time & OS (Built-in Python) 
• Modules: time, os 
• Use: Time delays (e.g., between UART transmissions), loop control, file system access for logging or debugging. 

8. Optional: imutils, picamera 
• imutils: For frame manipulation and contour detection (if needed for advanced processing). 
• picamera: Raspberry Pi camera interface if OpenCV's VideoCapture is insufficient or lacks exposure control options.
